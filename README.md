Description: 
Pin down the locaiton of the given username on the google map
For simplicity, I did not intergrate MongoDB because the dataset is small enough to stay in memory. However, I did included a Mongoose Schema module for later use.
Other module included:
- parse.js for parsing raw dataset(csv)into JSON file
